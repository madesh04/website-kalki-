## How to Use

### Viewing the Website
1. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the website.
2. Navigate through the pages using the navigation menu.

### Modifying Content

#### Text Content
All text content can be edited directly in the HTML files. Look for the text between tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.

Example:
```html
<p>This is sample text that you can edit.</p>
```

#### Images
1. Replace the placeholder images in the `/images/` directory with your own images.
2. Make sure to maintain the same file names or update the file paths in the HTML files.

Example image tag:
```html
<img src="images/products/wooden-blocks.jpg" alt="Wooden Building Blocks">
```

#### Colors and Styling
The website uses CSS variables for consistent styling. You can modify these variables in the `styles.css` file to change colors throughout the site.

Look for the `:root` section at the top of the CSS file:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #8B5A2B;
    --secondary-color: #D2B48C;
    /* more color variables */
}
```

### Adding Products
To add new products to the shop page:

1. In `shop.html`, find the product grid section.
2. Copy an existing product card and modify its content.

Example product card:
```html
<div class="product-card">
    <div class="product-image">
        <img src="images/products/new-product.jpg" alt="New Product Name">
        <div class="product-actions">
            <a href="product.html" class="quick-view">Quick View</a>
            <button class="add-to-cart">Add to Cart</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="product-info">
        <h3 class="product-title">New Product Name</h3>
        <div class="product-price">â‚¹999</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Modifying the Navigation Menu
To update the navigation menu, edit the `<nav>` section in each HTML file:

```html
<nav>
    <button class="mobile-menu-toggle">
        <i class="fas fa-bars"></i>
    </button>
    
    <ul class="nav-menu">
        <li class="nav-item"><a href="index.html" class="nav-link">Home</a></li>
        <!-- Add or modify menu items here -->
    </ul>
</nav>
```

### Contact Form
The contact form in `contact.html` is set up for demonstration purposes. To make it functional, you'll need to:

1. Add a form action attribute with your form handling endpoint
2. Implement server-side processing or use a form service like Formspree

Example:
```html
<form class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/your-email@example.com" method="POST">
```

### Shopping Cart Functionality
The shopping cart uses JavaScript and localStorage to manage cart items. The core functionality is in `scripts.js`. To modify:

1. Find the cart-related functions in `scripts.js`
2. Update as needed for your specific requirements
